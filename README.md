Advanced Web Security CTF Platform

A deliberately vulnerable web application built to practice real-world web exploitation techniques beyond basic OWASP labs.
This project is a full-stack Capture-The-Flag (CTF) platform that simulates modern web vulnerabilities found in production environments. Instead of toy examples, each challenge reflects realistic implementation mistakes commonly seen in APIs, authentication flows, cloud deployments, and business logic.

What You’ll Learn

==>How modern authentication systems fail in production
==>How API-centric apps introduce new attack surfaces
==>How client-side logic can bypass “secure” backends
==>How business logic flaws cause real financial breaches
==>How WAFs are bypassed in the real world

This application is intentionally vulnerable.
